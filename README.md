# ai_games_blog
Blog with automatically created game reviews using CHAT-GPT and api from RAWG.io
# Backend
The backend of the application, with the help of APIs provided by OpenAI and rawg.io, creates a "review" object at specified intervals and stores it in the database.
It also provides access to prepared "review" objects for our client application.
